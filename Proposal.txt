The setting for my soundscape project will include the various bus stops in Oakland, but primarily on Fifth and Forbes Ave. 
I'm hoping to capture the sounds of Oakland and the Port Authority buses as they pass through. 
I want to portray Oakland as a community with a great deal of hustle and bustle.
I also want the sounds of the buses to anchor the piece and provide the foundation.
